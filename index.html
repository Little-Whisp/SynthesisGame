            <p>
                Our team's target audience is children between 12/13 years old. Especially children who are in primary school in group 7/8. We chose this because these kids are a bit older and want a game that is a little more challenging.

            <a href="https://www.today.com/shop/best-video-games-kids-t193786">Best video games kids/today article - Consulted: 08.06.2022.</a>
        </p>
            This article mentions that children between the ages of 12 and 13 love games where they can explore the world and be creative. Think of Animal Crossing,
            Sims, Pokemon, and Minecraft. So there are many more.
            They also like to play with friends. Here you can see a few pronounce in the article by parents and children
            </p><p>


        </p>
            ''Kids will love the Sims because they can build anything they want, from a "house full of dogs" to a "yard where the entire plot is a pool," according to my son.''
            </p><p>
            ''Our family enjoys the downloadable content available for the Sims — packs of extra content that add new elements to the game. Our current favorite simulates the planet Batuu, located at Star Wars-themed Galaxy's Edge inside Disney Parks. (Yes, there's even a Baby Yoda.)''
        </p>
            ''My son only recently played through this older game.
            "It's funny and entertaining, and the missions are hard and challenging sometimes," he said. "I really liked it."
        </p><p>
            "There are so many ways you can approach everything," he said. "Every single monster has a weakness and you have to figure out the best way to defeat it, which weapon to use and the best form of attack."
        </p>
            These games challenge children to use their own creativity to complete a quest or level. With these types of games, you are encouraged to look around and learn more about the play style through trial and error and how to come up with solutions if you run into something without using a tutorial.
            </p><p>

            This article also recommends a number of games based on the rating. So there is no blood or adult content in these games. This usually makes the games a lot more appealing to parents who buy the games for their kids.
            It is also essential to see the parents as a target audience because they buy the games for their children. Something like GTA is not really kid-friendly,
            most parents prefer to buy something like Cuphead, Mario, or Zelda. Mainly also because these games look very colorful and although this does not mean that it is a game for children. Associate most adults with colorful cartoons with children.

            In this Reddit post, a user mentioned that cartoons were originally for children. For example, think about how exaggerated they designed the characters
            and the movements. This appeals to children more. It's helpful to know this so we can factor that into our game design.

                Our game is going to be playable via a website. You get a link and will be immediately directed to the main menu where you have the options: Start game, settings and exit.
                I mainly want to use simple platform controls. Think about jumping, moving left and right. (I also wish you could connect your controller) Didi should
                also be able to shoot seeds that can hit enemies. If the seeds are shot by Didi, you lose 1 and if Didi is hit by an enemy he loses health.

            <p>
            The idea is that the UI of the game is very simple and limited. This ensures that the player is not distracted while playing and has a better experience. The most important UI elements are your health,
            your number of seeds and the pause button where you have a save button and exit button.

                We wanted to have a very simplistic yet pretty visual art for our game mostly because it would give is more freedom with designing the character and world.
                Most pixel games keep their art style simple which give them the opportunity to less spend time on creating pretty art and more time to refine their art.
                For our backgrounds for each season we want to use a colour pallet that has 3 shades of the same colour. The further something is the lighter
                the colour, the closer something is the darker the colour.

            This is our style guide. This one was made by my teammate, Luke. We wanted to keep our style quite simple by working with calm colors and
            different shades in a color palette. For example, in the desert environment, we use warm colours of yellow, orange, and brown. The darker the color,
            the closer the object is. In addition, we want to use pixel art as the art type for our game.

            We made this game to learn children about biodiversity, plants and the importance of the enviroment.
            Climate change could lead to a similar world like in the game. It's important
            that young kids learn how to take care of our planet, so they can live and create
            a healthy world for their generation. We want to achieve this by also giving
            small facts about the plants you collect. As you explore each area you will also
            learn about what animal life lives there and what plants grow there.

                We wanted to make a game that our audience is gonna love. Something that they will find special. So we took the fundamentals of what a games are to heart that was mentioned during class:

            </p><p>

            <p>
                Goal: The goal of our game is, restoring a post-apocalyptic world by collecting seeds in different areas to teach kids about biodiversity and the importance of environments.
        </p><p>
                Rules: Each plant seed belongs to a different area. You’ll need to plant them in the right area in order to unlock new areas and better the flora in these areas. If you die, you lose your seeds and you will have to collect them again. All enemies will respawn and there is a limited time for you to be able to collect the seeds before they will change into a plant monster that you have to fight in order to regain the seeds, if you die in the battle vs the monster you will lose your seeds for good and have to restart collecting seeds. You won’t be unarmed. You will be able to protect yourself using your bubble gun and if an enemy is too strong you can use your collected seeds to do more damage.
            <p>
                Choices: You can choose how you want to rebuild the planet. If you prefer starting in an area where you have more rain, you are free to do so. The game challenges you to play it using your own creativity. As mentioned earlier you are also allowed to shoot with your collected seeds to do more damage but do this only when necessary. You will lose the seeds you use to kill an enemy, be very smart with how you use these mechanics.
        </p><p>

            <p>
                Gameplay: The gameplay is simple and easy to learn. You will only need to jump, move and shoot seeds to protect yourself from enemies and explore the environment.
        </p><p>

            <p>
                These are the most important ones we kept in mind. We brainstormed and came up with ideas to meet these subjects.
